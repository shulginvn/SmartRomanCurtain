# Smart Home Project with BMP280 sensor, Relay, Led and MQTT

With project allows get pressure, temperature, humidity from sensor and transmit to MQTT server by the external event from broker. Also you can also publish an event for switching an external relay via GPIO.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3/ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

Some development boards use an addressable LED instead of a regular one. These development boards include:

| Board                | LED type             | Pin                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| ESP32-C3-DevKitC-1   | Addressable          | GPIO8                |
| ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1   | Addressable          | GPIO8                |
| ESP32-S2-DevKitM-1   | Addressable          | GPIO18               |
| ESP32-S2-Saola-1     | Addressable          | GPIO18               |
| ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1   | Addressable          | GPIO48               |

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`). 

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Select the LED type in the `Blink LED type` option.
    * Use `GPIO` for regular LED blink.
    * Use `RMT` for addressable LED blink.
        * Use `RMT Channel` to select the RMT peripheral channel.
* Set the GPIO number used for the signal in the `Blink GPIO number` option.
* Set the blinking period in the `Blink period in ms` option.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Troubleshooting

* If the LED isn't blinking, check the GPIO or the LED type selection in the `Example Configuration` menu.
